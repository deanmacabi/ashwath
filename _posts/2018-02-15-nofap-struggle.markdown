# Why NoFap will NOT solve your problems

![Achieve Your Goals]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pic7.png)

#### First of all, Let me admit, I used to be a ‘no fap’ advocator for years (back when the first Ted video about it published) and I instantly ‘bought’ into this idea… 
#### Years passed, and I’ve changed many things in my life till I have found my way to happiness, and I want to share with you today my realization about NoFap, and why it has NOTHING to do with your success or joy in life, so you may focus on other things, whatever they are.

#### Have you ever thought what is the reason behind nofap regardless of the big ‘buzz’ around it? And what it has to do with providing solutions for your problems?

#### I assume many of you has problems such as not feeling enough confident, sociable, or just suffering from anxiety, etc… 
#### My question is, why do you think NoFap is one of the responsibilities for that?

### Have you ever questioned why sex is fine, and NoFap is not? Isn’t it the one and the same, merely a different ‘technique’?

> “To me, it is like someone claims that certain food makes them less confident so they avoid it but consumes the same food in a restaurant is just fine”
>Sound ridiculous to me, how about you?

#### I’m not claiming that you don’t have any struggles, all I’m questioning is what NoFap has to do with that at all?

#### I’ve watched and read many researchers about NoFap. They can say whatever they want, but from objective observation, it doesn’t make any sense, at least to me.

> So what I suggest you is to ask yourself, how can you solve your struggles or problems by eliminating something which has nothing to do with the actual reason that causing the problem you are experiencing at first place?
