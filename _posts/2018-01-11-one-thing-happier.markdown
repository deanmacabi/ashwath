# The only ONE thing you need to understand to be happy

![brainwash]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pic2.png)

#### I keep seeing so many posts such as, five tips how to become successful, nine routines that will make you happy, five rules to become wealthy. 
#### But what are they providing us, other than a comforting feeling? Have you ever thought about that?

#### First of all, let me make sure you understand that I have nothing at all against those tips and they are indeed sound amazing or even perfect in theory.
#### The question though is what happens in reality..?

#### What I mean by that is this. Are those goals/missions/keys or whatever you want to call it, have got you where you want to be? If yes, I would assume you will not read this post nor any other. 
#### So I guess the answer is no, which means it didn’t solve you any problem yet nor got you to where you want to be.

#### So if you are ‘wondering’ what I’m suggesting instead is this.. before I tell it I want to admit it changed my life completely, after years of searching for the right key/routine/tip. It is called:

> Critical Thinking / Self Questioning

#### I assume you’ve heard it before… Although questioning may seem easy, it is going to take you a while to figure everything you want and need to realize, however, in my opinion, it worth every moment ‘spent’ on it. 

#### Good luck.
