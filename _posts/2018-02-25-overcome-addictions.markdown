### I assume you have or had an addiction to something, and we all know how sucks and devastating it is while someone takes part in such activity. It doesn't even matter what you are addicted, as in the end, we all know addiction is an action that influences negatively on us whether emotional, physically or usually both. Yes, there is no doubt that some addictions are more harmful than others, but the root of all addictions is the same.

## So why you have those addictions in the first place? Have you ever questioned it at all? And if so what is the solution to remove and solve it? 

### I assume most of you think they know what the method to fix your addictions/struggles right is? But why are you so sure about 'your' way? If the method/technique you are using, whatever it is, was working were you still addicted? 
Think about it for a moment, if you claim that you know how to solve your addiction how come you are still looking for solutions? And one last thing, I'm sure without knowing anything about you that this method whatever it is that you claim to solve your issues, already been 'used' by you for a long time. However, it hasn't solved any of your struggles or addictions by now... so when it will tomorrow? But tomorrow becomes today, and you are still struggling. 
So all I'm asking is this, Has it solved your addictions and if not why do you keep following that specific path? If it indeed solves, Would you be here reading this post?

## Now it is the time to share with you my solution, to all of this, so here it goes:
###My first tip that I would suggest is stop listening to all those people who claim there is a 'one way' for everyone to get rid of one's individual struggles, it is simply NOT possible biologically and scientifically speaking.
Second of all I would suggest you look at your problems from an objective point of view and figure the root-source of your struggles and understand what caused those addictions to arise in the first place. After you have realized this crucial step, You should figure what is wrong with your current thought and behavioral patterns which causes you to suffer from it either directly / indirectly, and by doing that you will eventually eliminate your struggles. 
I assume you already know people who think like you less or more but don't suffer from those difficulties you are going through so there must be a way out, you just need to figure the right soultions for you. Good luck.
