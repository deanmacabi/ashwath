![Live in the moment]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pic5.jpeg)

### I often speak with many of my readers, and one of the topics they iterate the most is that they are struggling to live in the present. So if you struggle with it too, you got to the right place.

## First of all, I want you to ask yourself this:

> 1. Why can’t you be in the present?
> 2. What difficulties are you going through that doesn’t let you focus on the here and now?

### After you answer those two questions above, You should figure what the main reasons which prevent you from being in this moment are.

### I suggest you ask yourself if those problems are that urgent and if it can be solved by thinking about them so often?

### I am sure after you will do ask those questions repeatedly, you will figure the answers to those questions for yourself and will finally be able to live much more often at the moment.

> I feel just fine at any time, and I don’t see any reason why you shouldn’t feel that way as well — If you think otherwise feel free to comment below or on my website why you can’t live in the moment, and I’ll try to show you otherwise.

_If after doing so you still feel like you are often in the past or the future or if you just can’t find the right answers to those questions, contact me with what is that you are currently struggling with for free personal advice, through the comments below or via my website._
