![Why are you struggle]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pic6.png)

### assume many of you have a negative feeling regarding some of your actions, whether it is when you do not accomplish tasks or doing something that you planned not to do such as: 
### Plan a workout for the evening however you didn’t train.
### Writing in the calendar to work on this project but never get it done,
### Or just promising yourself not to eat this candy but you just couldn’t resist it.
### First of all, I want you to ask yourself this:

> So what I want you to do is ask yourself this: Why didn’t I completed what I wanted to do?

### I want you to write everything that you can think of when you are pondering on this question.

## Answering for yourself the question above should get you to realize this one crucial thing:

> Why didn’t I accomplish the tasks as I wanted and planned

<h4> _Only by realizing it, you will have a chance to change and solve it._ </h4>

_Feel free to share with me what were your thoughts on those questions,
Such as what are you currently struggling with and what is your worst obstacle._
