#### Before I get into this topic, I know I’m on an entrepreneurship community, and this may be contradicting. However, I’m an entrepreneur myself, and I guess you too. Therefore I think this is the right place to share it.

#### I am sure you’ve heard about minimalism before, but if you were not sure why and what makes it the right way, you came to the right place.

#### Now let’s dive into the topic. The main reason that I say minimalism is the only way for happiness is that excess stuff just can’t make us happy. 
I can tell dozens of reasons why it is true. However, I think this one metaphor that I came up with, summarizes it pretty well:

> “it is like saying, if I was 20cm taller then I would be happy.”

#### Funny, isn’t it? What I mean by that is even if you were 20 cm taller or had all the excess stuff that you think you want, what the hell it has to do with your happiness???

#### Nonetheless, if you are still bothering, there are countless of studies that show just what I’ve iterated above, by inquiring thousands of people both minimalists and maximalists.

#### So if you were in doubt or were not sure exactly why minimalism is the right way, by now, I’m pretty sure you have figured it out.
