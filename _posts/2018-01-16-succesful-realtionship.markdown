### If you answered yes to the question above, then this is the only thing you need to ask yourself in order to be able to flirt with any woman you want!

### This topic, in general, is a big one for most of my readers and people all around the world.

> The question I want you to ask yourself today which changed my life completely when it comes to women is this:

### What prevent you from approaching any beautiful girl right now?
Asking this question for myself solve me any personal struggle I had to speak with any girl I want to and eliminated once and forever this issue of approaching girls. No tip/ method/ technique helped me solve this issue but this simple question, so just ask yourself:

> why can’t you approach any girl you want right now?

## Try answer this as profoundly as you can, eventually will dissolve your problems.

### Just to make myself clear, it is not one minute nor one-day process. You have to examine everything that causes you to feel the way you do which can take months so you can finally eliminate it.
